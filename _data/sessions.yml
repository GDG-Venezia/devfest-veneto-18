  title: "Serverless Event-driven Architecture with Kotlin: the Pixartprinting use case"
  description: "Serverless is one of the hottest trend topic since cloud became so pop. Unfortunately, the transition between a \"classic\" synchronous architecture to a serverless asynchronous one is not trivial. In this talk we're going to understand what does it takes to switch to serverless with a Kotlin backend application, thanks to Serverless Framework, and how Pixartprintin adopted this tecnology in order to transform its own architecture into an event-driven, asynchronous, scalable, but mostly serverless one."

  title: "BlockChain, la (non) rivoluzione ci aspetta!"
  description: Blockchain e Bitcoin sono parole che oramai si sentono perfino al telegiornale o nei saloni di bellezza, quando non troppo tempo fa, erano solite monopolizzare le chiacchiere da pub di qualche nerd. Ma veramente questa tecnologia, oltre a catalizzare un'enorme attenzione, sarà alla base dei servizi più comuni del prossimo futuro? O sarà così marginale che inizieremo a chiamarla FlopChain? Un talk poco tecnico che ma punta all'essenza della blockchain lanciando uno sguardo al futuro."
